# tap-applovin

`tap-applovin` is a Singer tap for applovin.

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

## Features
- Leverages the `report` endpoint from the [Applovin API](https://developers.applovin.com/en/audience-plus/reporting-api)
in order to grab hourly summaries
of ad performance by campaign, creative, country, and platform.
- Configure the date range you want to grab data from using the `report_range_days` config variable.
- Built with the Singer SDK for extensibility and Meltano compatibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

- Applovin API key

- Singer SDK

- Meltano (optional, for pipeline orchestration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tap-applovin.git
  cd tap-applovin
  ```
2. Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
3. Activate the Poetry virtual environment:
  ```bash
  poetry shell
  ```

## Configuration

1. Create a config.json file with the following structure:
  ```bash
  {
    "api_key": YOUR_APPOVIN_API_KEY,
    "start_date": 2025-03-26 
  }
  ```
  - `api_key`: Your Applovin API key.

  - `start_date`: format YYYY:MM:DD

2. Place config.json in the root directory or pass its path as an argument when running the tap.

## Running the Tap

1. Run the tap standalone:
  ```bash
  poetry run python -m tap_applovin --config config.json
  ```
2. Use with Meltano for pipeline orchestration:
  - Add the tap to your Meltano project:
  ```bash
  meltano add extractor tap-applovin
  ```
  - Configure the tap in meltano.yml:
  ```bash
  extractors:
    tap-applovin:
      config:
        api_key: YOUR_APPOVIN_API_KEY
        start_date: 2025-03-26
  ```
  - Run the tap via Meltano:
  ```bash
  meltano run tap-applovin target-your-target
  ```

### Accepted Config Options

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-applovin --about
```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-applovin
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-applovin --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano run tap-applovin target-jsonl
```

## Customization

The streams.py file provides the main logic for fetching and processing data. Key points
of customization include:
- **Columns:** Update the columns list to fetch additional fields.

- **Date Range:** Modify the date_range method to adjust date partitioning.

- **API Parameters:** Customize the get_url_params method to include additional query parameters.

## Development

1. Install development dependencies using Poetry:
  ```bash
  poetry install --with dev
  ```
2. Run tests:
  ```bash
  poery run pytest
  ```
